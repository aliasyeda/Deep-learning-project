# Deep-learning-project

# üê∂üê± Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using CNN

This is an internship project that demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset and predicts whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The project includes model training, evaluation, sample testing, and visual documentation.

---

## üéØ Objective

To develop and evaluate a CNN-based image classifier capable of distinguishing between cat and dog images with high accuracy, using supervised deep learning techniques.


## üß† Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Drive (for hosting large files)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

üì¶ Dataset & Model
The project originally used the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images. Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full dataset and trained model are not included in the repository.

‚úÖ Instead, a few sample images are included for testing (cat1.jpg,cat2.jpg, dog1.jpg,dog2.jpg)

‚úÖ The trained model file (cat_dog_classifier_model.h5) can be downloaded below

 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ekeq8iLwJYBqruNrgtrlBpn0PwpyJ4DF/view?usp=sharing
 
üëâ Download Trained Model from Google Drive

After downloading, place the model file in the project folder. Load it in the notebook using:

python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('cat_dog_classifier_model.h5')

üì∑ Screenshots

Screenshots included :

Terminal showing the application running

Browser window with the prediction app UI

Notebook with model prediction results

These were captured as part of the internship submission requirements.

üöÄ How to Run the Project

Clone or download this repository

Install required libraries (TensorFlow, etc.)

Download the .h5 model file from the Google Drive link

Place the model file in the project directory

Open and run cats_vs_dogs.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Use the sample images (cat1.jpg, cat2.jpg,dog1.jpg, dog2.jpg) to test predictions

‚úÖ Project Status

 Model successfully trained and saved

 Notebook fully implemented and tested

 Screenshots captured

üìå Notes

The full dataset and model are hosted externally to reduce GitHub storage usage.

All essential project components are included and documented.

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in image classification using CNNs.
